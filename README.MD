* The process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called a recursive function.
* Using recursive algorithm, certain problems can be solved quite easily. 
* Examples of such problems are Towers of Hanoi (TOH), In-order/Pre-order/Post-order Tree Traversals, DFS of Graph, etc.
